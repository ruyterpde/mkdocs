Credits & Shoutouts!

This little corner of the internet didn’t come together in a vacuum. It’s built on the shoulders of some amazing tools, open-source projects, and generous communities who’ve shared their work, knowledge, and time.

- Here’s a non-exhaustive list of the stuff (and people) that helped make this site—and the ideas in it—possible:

- Open-source everything – From code editors to static site generators, I owe a huge thanks to the open-source community. Special mentions to [Home-Assistant], [MkDocs], and [Material] for making my life easier.

- Docs, forums & stack traces – The unsung heroes. Stack Overflow, GitHub Issues, and countless random blog posts saved me more times than I can count.

- Fonts, icons & UI bits – Some visual flair courtesy of [Font/Design Resource] and [Icon Set], because why not make things look nice while we’re here?

- Friends, mentors & internet strangers – Whether it was a tip in a Discord thread or a late-night debug session, I’m grateful for every bit of help along the way.

- My past self – For bothering to write things down when I didn’t feel like it. You did good, buddy.

This is all a patchwork of shared knowledge and personal trial-and-error, stitched together into something (hopefully) useful. If I’ve missed giving credit where it's due, it wasn’t intentional—just let me know and I’ll fix it.  

Thanks to everyone who helped—even if you didn’t know you did.
