# Introduction

CloudConvert is a powerful cloud-based file conversion service that supports over 200 formats including documents, images, audio, video, and more. This tutorial walks you through using the **CloudConvert API v2** to automate file conversions in your applications.

# Overview

Manually converting files between formats is time-consuming and error-prone. This tutorial solves that by demonstrating how to:

- Authenticate with the CloudConvert API
- Create a conversion job
- Import a file from a URL
- Convert it to another format
- Export the result

By the end, you'll have a working example of a complete file conversion workflow using CloudConvert's REST API.

# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A [CloudConvert account](https://cloudconvert.com/register)
- An API key from your [CloudConvert dashboard](https://cloudconvert.com/dashboard/api/v2/keys)
- Basic knowledge of REST APIs and JSON
- A tool like `curl`, Postman, or a programming language with HTTP support (e.g., Python, Node.js)

# Execution

## 1. Create a Job

<<<json
POST https://api.cloudconvert.com/v2/jobs
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tasks": {
    "import-my-file": {
      "operation": "import/url",
      "url": "https://example.com/input.docx"
    },
    "convert-my-file": {
      "operation": "convert",
      "input": "import-my-file",
      "output_format": "pdf"
    },
    "export-my-file": {
      "operation": "export/url",
      "input": "convert-my-file"
    }
  }
}
>>>

## 2. Monitor Job Status

<<<sh
curl -X GET https://api.cloudconvert.com/v2/jobs/JOB_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
>>>

Look for `"status": "finished"` in the response.

## 3. Download the Output

Once the job is complete, retrieve the export URL:

<<<sh
curl -X GET https://api.cloudconvert.com/v2/tasks/TASK_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
>>>

The response will include a `result.files[0].url` field. Download the file from that URL.

# Validation

To verify the outcome:

- Confirm the job status is `finished`
- Ensure the output file is accessible and correctly formatted
- Open the file and check for content integrity

# Tearing down

No persistent resources are created, but for good hygiene:

- Revoke unused API keys from your [CloudConvert dashboard](https://cloudconvert.com/dashboard/api/v2/keys)
- Delete temporary files downloaded during testing

# Conclusion

Youâ€™ve now learned how to:

- Authenticate and interact with the CloudConvert API
- Chain tasks to import, convert, and export files
- Monitor job status and retrieve results

This workflow can be integrated into backend services, automation pipelines, or user-facing applications. For more advanced use cases, explore the [official CloudConvert API docs](https://cloudconvert.com/api/v2) and SDKs for Python, Node.js, and more.
