# About

Welcome to RUYTER.ORG (dms), the organized chaos of my brain!

Here you'll find an ever-growing collection of notes, ideas, and how-to's on all sorts of topics I've explored - tech stuff, tools, tiny side projects, and whatever else caught my curiosity.  
It's not perfect, and it's not always polished, but it's real and (hopefully) helpful.

Everything here was written mainly for my future self, but if it helps you too, awesome!
Dive in, poke around, and make of it what you will.
